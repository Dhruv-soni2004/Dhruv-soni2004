### Hi There,
My name is Dhruv Soni, a small learning programer 😅.

I'm currently learning the front end languages like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, BOOTHSTRAP, etc. but afterwards I'll be learning the back end languages like PHP, mySQL, etc.😎

My main moto is to become a successful business man, then why learn coding ? 🤔 This is because In future when I become a business man and will know how to run a business, I'll also have a complete idea about digital marketing 😆 and will know how to take our business online😉 so that we can grow the business 😏. Also, we don't need to hire anyone in order to take our business online.

My Dream WebSite is about our business (E-Commerce WebSite). 😀

When I'll complete with my front end course, then I'll start designing my E-Commerce Website 🤭 and When I'll complete with my back end course, I'll start the back end part of my website 😋.
